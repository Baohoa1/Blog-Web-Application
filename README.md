# Blog-Web-Application

A simple Blog Web Application built from Node.js and Express.js, with Bootstrap for layout and some CSS code for styling. This website has essential features like creating, editing, and deleting posts. However, no server built into this website will delete the posts after refreshing the page.

### Description
This is a simple version of a Blog web application. Users can create posts with their full name, blog title, and blog content. After they finish their blog, they can view it, or if they want to fix something, they can edit the post. Last but not least, users can delete their posts. However, there is no authentication security built into this website, and no hard-built-in server, so the posts would disappear after reloading the page.

### Languages
