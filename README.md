# Blog-Web-Application

A simple Blog Web Application built from Node.js and Express.js, with Bootstrap for layout and some CSS code for styling. This website has essential features like creating, editing, and deleting posts. However, no server built into this website will delete the posts after refreshing the page.

### Languages
